You are a frog (like a [turtle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)?#Turtle_and_graphics)). Not just any frog, a [glass frog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_frog). Look at your hand, you can see straight through it! The bones and nerves and muscles!

You can make another frog by running `spawn`. You will be asked some questions, like the name of the new frog, how many arms it has, does it have eyes? Important questions of course but you might not know some of the answers yet, you can answer those later.

Frogs can do all kinds of things! You would know, as a frog yourself. You can ask one of the frogs in your computer to do something by `croak`ing.

You can see all your frogs by looking in the `pond`.
